## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.rating-item::before {
    content: "";
    display: block;
    width: 6rem;
    height: 1rem;
    margin: 0 auto 1rem;
    background-image: url(../img/icon-star.svg);
    background-repeat: space;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

The use of flexbox, grid, sementic markup and best practices.

### Useful resources

-   (https://www.w3schools.com) - This helped with learning both html and css, but there's various other sites that you could learn it too.

-   (https://www.freecodecamp.org) - This helped searching for specific solutions to my problem at hand. Used freecodecamp in conjunction with w3schools.
